We are working frantically on a new definition of xxx for ccc and we came up with a new simplified evaluation methodology based on customer intent.

We are looking for volunteers to help us in the next 48hrs to create a quick simple interface/tool to capture www evaluation flow. 
So it needs to drive a flow given a type of query (broad or narrow) and evaluators answers, as well capturing these answers. 
It has to operate also independently on local computers (as POC). Simplicity and effectiveness are the keywords here!

We can give more details - but for now is just the call for action and see if we have some warriors ready to join us asap.

If you answer first to this note we will name the tool after yours :).

Please let me know!
