I’m sharing this exciting accomplishment, and xxx has been BIG part of this massive and critical project along 
with 25+ other teams and 150 people involved!
 
Because of our team’s dedication, hard work, and meticulous planning and execution, xxx has long been code complete and 
well tested. During the signing off and launching phases, xxx did NOT have a single P1 level issue!
 
Congratulations, and great job WELL DONE!!!
