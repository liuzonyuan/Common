I’m sharing this exciting accomplishment, and xxx has been BIG part of this massive and critical project along 
with 25+ other teams and 150 people involved!
 
Because of our team’s dedication, hard work, and meticulous planning and execution, xxx has long been code complete and 
well tested. During the signing off and launching phases, xxx did NOT have a single P1 level issue!
 
Congratulations, and great job WELL DONE!!!


----------

We are very excited to announce launch of xxx integration through ccc and enabling eee support for rrr. We also took this opportunity to add a new ttt in ppp to bbb a feature in run-time based on the request context (page type, device type, client and verticals). 
The motivation for this effort was to standardize and simplify a/b test setup for preso based experimentation, enable multiple orthogonal A/B test execution for polaris run-time and relevance, and last but not least add support for dynamic control for feature knobs based on the request context.
 
Benefits from current optimization:
Standardization and simplified xxxx.
Don’t need to create eee.
Enabled 
Currently, a user/request cannot be assigned to more than ttt. This increases delay in conducting aaa for which more traffic is required

I would like take this opportunity to thank vvv (enabling rrr) and yyy (enabling mmm) for their extra-ordinary effort and attention to details. 
I also want to thank to vvv for architecture and design of dsfsad and mz for leadership and continuous support.
 
Here are the documentation with complete details:
