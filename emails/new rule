Moving forward every production release will require a xxx to go along with. 
This requirement is in place to help bring visibility outbound on ccc changes.
 
To simplify the process we have created templates that can be easily cloned to expedite releases. 
Currently ccc and ccc are now following this process. The long term goal is to automate the process into a visible dashboard of all changes. 
 
If you have a eeee production deployment coordinate with your TPM for roll out, or reach out to @rrr for scheduling and coordination. 
We will be working with all workstream and platform teams in the near term to setup a one-time template.
