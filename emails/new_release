Happy New Year!
 
I’m super excited to share with everyone that on Monday, November 25th, the xxx program successfully launched the 
first yyy items on Walmart.com, with all ccc scheduled to be 100% live on Tuesday, May 8th. 
Over 35+ teams across the company have been working incredibly hard to build the capability which will allow customers 
to upgrade their ccc on our site. As a note, the ddd plan is based on percentage of total xxx, not percentage of traffic.
 
Background
The first business case for ggg was completed in 2015, but as you can imagine, the level of complexity to build this type

mid-2019! Because this has been a long desired experience for our customers, enabling this capability not only increases 
our competitive advantage in the ddd marketplace, but also gets us one step closer to truly delivering an omnichannel 
experience for the ccc business.
 
Goal
The goal of the overall cccc\ Program is to build a comprehensive and easy to navigate ddd experience for ccc customers, 
both online and in stores
 
How it works (MVP)

To process a return, customers will need to return to a local ccc store
 
What’s next?
Teams will soon begin work and discovery on the following features to expand the xxx experience:
